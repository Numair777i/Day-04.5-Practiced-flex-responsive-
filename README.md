<h1>Guide for resposive Ui for myself</h1>
1. Go for flex instead of block so it can be a little more responsive, also it will show some gaps too as it will be only having text-length width and the cards would be able to use that space.

2.Use flex: 1 1 auto;
	>flex grow will take the unused 	row/column space.
	>flex shrink will shrink to not have 	horizontal scroll bars.
	>flex basis will set the minimum 	size as per the device.
 
3.use @media queries
